- Joined by [Mathias Doenitz](http://www.decodified.com/) (aka [@sirthias](https://twitter.com/sirthias)), lead developer of [Spray](http://spray.io/), living in southwest Germany.
- Loves the challenge and learning opportunities that Scala presents. No more daily grind!
- Spray is a collection of libraries for working with TCP/IP and HTTP.
It's pure Scala + [Akka](http://akka.io/) all the way down to the bare sockets.
It is fully asynchronous.
- Why not use [servlets](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/Servlet.html)?
  - Spray can be used on servlets containers if you choose, but most people want to do away with the overhead of servlets and their XML configuration.
  - Servlets are server-side only, without a corresponding client library.
  - The servlet API's age really shows its age in that it
    - Uses mutability.
    - Lacks modern function Scala niceness like case classes and typeclasses.
    - Lacks streaming + chunked message support.
    - Conceals connection management.
    - Conceals thread pool management.
    - Makes it difficult to monitor/trace your application.
- Why not use [Netty](https://netty.io/)?
It's great software, but still not Scala *all the way down*.
It's helpful to have the same stack (Scala, Akka, [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config), [Typesafe Console](http://typesafe.com/products/console), etc) all the way through, without adapter layers.
The Spray primitives are the Akka, Config, etc. primitives.
- Spray is nicely layered. If you need to go lower level, you can always go lower level.
There are no black boxes until you reach [Java NIO](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/package-summary.html).
- Other Scala web frameworks may be [elephants all the way down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down), but they're not *Scala elephants* all the way down.
- Core principles of Spray:
  - Non-blocking and asynchronous code whenever possible.
  - Actor and future-based design. (Also in some cases continuation-passing).
  - Highly optimized for high-load environments (think 100,000 open connections).
  - Lightweight, with very few dependencies.
- Best practices for actors is still evolving.
  - To avoid throttling problems with actors, Spray uses push-back to the network via TCP flow control.
  - Spray has ocassionally had problems with untyped-ness of actors.
  - [Derek Wyatt](http://derekwyatt.org/)'s [forthcoming book](http://www.artima.com/shop/akka_concurrency) will provide valuable information.
- [spray-io](http://spray.io/documentation/spray-io/) sits directly on top of Java NIO.
  - It is a more faithful representation of packet-based networking.
  It does not attempt to represent communication as a continuous (blocking) flow of bytes.
  Instead, spray-io is fully message-based.
  - Each actor message contains just they bytes that could be read from the network without blocking. 
  - There are even cases where Java NIO is too high level, inefficient, or just not thread safe, and Spray is considering some native enhancements.
- [spray-can](http://spray.io/documentation/spray-can/#spray-can) is built on spray-io.
It provides a low-level HTTP server & client.
In other words, spray-can brings spray-io up from TCP/IP to HTTP.
  - The client functionality was originally written just for internal tests.
  - The case class (model-only) [spray-http](http://spray.io/documentation/spray-http/) module exists so the client and server components can use the same model.
  - When the client and server share the same model, certain tasks become really easy, like writing proxies.
- [spray-client](http://spray.io/documentation/spray-client/) provides high-level HTTP client functionality.
For example, it lets you abstract over the different kinds of connections to a common request-based API.
- Spray has two main levels of runtime monitoring
  - Logging directly onto Akka's [event bus](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.5/scala/event-bus.html).
  Since Spray is Akka all the way down, you can do more with simple logging than is possible in black-box frameworks.
  - The [Typesafe Console](http://typesafe.com/products/console). Spray and [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com/) are working together to make sure Spray gets maximum benefit from the Console.
