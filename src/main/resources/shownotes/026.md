- Joined by [Stefan Zeiger](http://szeiger.de/) from [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com/), core contributor to [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/), "Scala Language-Integrated Connection Kit".
- Started [ScalaQuery](http://scalaquery.org/) as a pet project in spare time.
- Slick involves work in library space as well as in the language itself, e.g., macros.
[Macros](http://scalamacros.org/) support everything from better error messages to type providers and compilation to SQL.
- Eventually a major expansion on for-comprehensions, called [comprehensive comprehensions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vE7ftE_czD7OC70zq19nbbWWuEuRHFXDzv3MG8J-mfM/edit?hl=en_US) may be needed by Slick.
- Three front-ends
  - Slick has three front-ends: Lifted embedding, direct embedding, and plain SQL.
The first and last are the evolution of ScalaQuery. Direct embedding is totally new.
  - Lifted embedding, like ScalaQuery, makes you work with wrapped types, like `Rep[Int]` instead of `Int` for an integer column value.
Direct embedding lets you work with `Int` directly.
  - The plain SQL front-end is mostly an abstraction on top of JDBC.
Provides injection-proof string interpolation.
  - Lifted and direct embedding provide a common query optimizer and compiler that gets fed into the JDBC infrastructure.
  - Lifted and direct embedding have different strengths.
Direct embedding can't completely replace lifted yet, even though it has some compelling advantages.
- [Squeryl](http://squeryl.org/) tries to stay close to SQL, while Slick tries to move away from SQL.
It's hard to compose SQL while remaining confident the generated SQL won't fail.
Part of the problem is that Slick doesn't see the incoming code, only the computed values.
- NoSQL databases will be supported, starting with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).
Most relational assumptions have already been removed from the master branch of Slick.
Table declaration assumption still need to be eliminated, since Mongo works on [nested structured documents](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/BSON).
- [Slick TestKit](http://slick.typesafe.com/doc/1.0.0-RC1/testkit.html) is published as its own artifact.
- Comparison to traditional ORMs
  - At the moment direct embedding is tied directly to case classes and lifted embedding to tuples.
It's difficult for lifted embedding to use case classes without boilerplate.
  - Lazy loading is hard to implement efficiently since you don't know the iteration pattern (i.e., the whole query) in advance.
Slick does not support it.
Slick wants operations to be bounded by the complexity of the query, and not the number of results.
Cf. [n + 1 problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem).
  - Slick also avoids magic surrounding mutability, caching, and sessions.
- Future versions
  - 1.0 should be out by the end of January.
  - Removing dependency on JDBC and SQL in core.
  - Adding type providers [Ã  la .NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh156509.aspx).
  They will allow your declared schema to be verified.
  This feature relies on type macros, expected to make Scala 2.11, currently available in [Macros Paradise](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html).
  - MongoDB support.
- Community role in Slick is currently small, but getting bigger.
More input & help is welcome, especially in the driver implementations.
