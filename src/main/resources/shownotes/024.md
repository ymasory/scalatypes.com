- Joined by [Ivan Carrero](http://flanders.co.nz/), aka [casualjim](https://github.com/casualjim"), core developer of [Scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org/) and [Json4s](https://github.com/json4s/json4s).
- Ivan developed .NET for 7 years and Ruby for 2 years, including C# [MVP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649571.aspx). Contributed to ASP.NET [Contrib](http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/), and [MonoRail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MonoRail_(software)), [IronRuby MVC](https://github.com/casualjim/ironrubymvc).
- Moved from Ruby to Scala because of [Akka](http://akka.io/)'s performance.
- Ivan's comments on type erasure gets this episode an "explicit" tag on iTunes! But Scala 2.10 will fix most of his language gripes.
- Scalatra is a tiny web framework inspired by [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). Core philosophy: everything is extensible by default; you should never be worked into a corner.
- Sinatra is a thin layer of [Rack](http://rack.github.com/) (Ruby web server interface, think Servlets) and HTTP. Sinatra stays out of your way. Not opinionated like [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
- Sinatra lacks model, validation, etc support. [Padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/) complements Sinatra, especially for developers not writing an API service.
- Scalatra's core is a direct port of Sinatra, except for the route-matching strategy. Once you bring in modules outside core, Sinatra is Padrino and more.
- The biggest competitors are [Play](http://www.playframework.org/) & [Lift](http://liftweb.net/). Play is inspired by Rails and is likewise opinionated.
- [Finagle](http://twitter.github.com/finagle/) has beautiful routes extraction.
- The Sinatra-style route matching lets you understand a web app without jumping around too much in the files.
- Scalatra is designed to be easy to use, "zero to hero". Cleverness is avoided. "Hello World" is 4 lines.
- Route patterns are the arguments to the blocks they execute.
- Templating is done with [Scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org/) (How is that pronounced?!), which gives you 4 different templating languages to choose from (2 of which are xml/html DSLs). Integrations exist for others too.
- Separate support for [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) and [Lift-Json](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/JSON_Support) lead to [Json4s](https://github.com/json4s/json4s), [one AST to rule them all](http://flanders.co.nz/2012/10/25/json4s-one-ast-to-rule-them-all)! Currently Jackson and Lift implementations exist, and discussions are underway with [Spray](https://github.com/spray/spray-json) (a [Parboiled](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki) parser).
- Json4s also provides monadic ways of manipulating the AST.
- Scalatra accomplished extensibility mostly through the use of [stackable modifications](http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/stackable_trait_pattern.html), callbacks, and inheritance. Mix-in order generally does not matter.
- Scalatra comes with Sentry, an auth module inspired by [Warden](https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki/overview). It can protect routes or entire servlets.
- Some kinds of re-usability, in absence of a framework-wide opinions, is a rendering pipeline.
- Scalatra takes advantage of [Servlet 3.0](http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2008/10/14/introduction-to-servlet-3.html)'s support for asynchronous requests and responses, hooking them to Akka [futures](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.1/scala/futures.html). Suspending requests allows you to free the thread while other requests are handled.
- [Netty](https://netty.io/) requires you to parse chunks of a request, where a Servlet container gives you that for free. [Jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/) is mostly as fast as Netty until you get to web sockets and persistent connections.
- [Jeanfrancois Arcand](http://jfarcand.wordpress.com/author/jfarcand/) (of [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) and [async-http-client](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client) fame) and Ivan are looking to bring Scalatra to Netty. Currently the Netty branch doesn't perform as well as the Jetty version.
- Scalatra [commands](http://scalatra.org/2.2/guides/commands.html) provide validation. Unlike most frameworks, it validates the request headers and bodies directly, not waiting for de-serialization into a model. Inspired by the [CQRS pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html). Ad-hoc typeclasses can convert them to model classes.
- [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com/) is a service description language, but nothing like [WSDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language)! It's all about the metadata &hellip; once you have it, you can examine it in code and make decisions based on it.
- Swagger integration is provided in the form of method calls that are fed to the Swagger documentation and code generator.
- Integration with Atmosphere provides a servlet container agnostic way to do web sockets, comets, server-side events, etc. It can fall back to long polling for browsers without a socket implementation.
- Upcoming: [etag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag)-based caching with pluggable back-ends.
- Upcoming: metrics [Coda Hale](http://codahale.com/)'s [Metrics](http://metrics.codahale.com/) library).
- Upcoming: [SwaggerSocket](https://github.com/wordnik/swaggersocket) support.
- Upcoming: making it more difficult to accidentally close over [scala.util.DynamicVariable](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/DynamicVariable.html) request/response objects in an Akka future.
- Scalatra is used by BBC, the British Government, IGN, Jelastic, LinkedIn, the Guardian, and others.
- A Scalatra book is coming out in 2013, published by Manning.
