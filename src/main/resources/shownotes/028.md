- Part 2 of the Interview with Mathias Doenitz on Spray. Part 1 is [here](http://scalatypes.com/episode-27-mathias-doenitz-on-spray-part-1).
- [spray-routing](http://spray.io/documentation/spray-routing/) bridges the API interface directly to your application.
  - It does more than just routing, however.
  - It creates a structure that determines what logic will be performed on incoming requests.
  - Unlike [Scalatra](http://scalatra.org/guides/routes-and-actions.html), which handles paths as strings, spray-routing uses strong types for path parameters.
  - Unlike [Play](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0/ScalaRouting), the set of supported types is open, allowing the developer to bind custom types in routes.
  - No pattern matching is used.
  - Extremely DRY courtesy of [Shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless).
- Is Spray a full blown web framework?
  - Not really. Web GUIs has not been the focus of development so far.
  - Session stores, database integration, templating, Javascript integration, ajax support, form support, etc are not provided by Spray.
  Spray focuses on the API level.
  - This may change in the future.
- Who's the most restful?
  - Write your application in Javascript, with the back-end being an API only.
  - Or, [ROCA](http://roca-style.org/) Style. Read the manifesto!
- With input chunking in the application layer, how do you take advantage of ecosystem libraries that expect a blocking input stream?
  - There isn't a really great asynchronous solution.
  You could buffer chunks and send them to the blocking interface.
  - At the moment Spray doesn't have a solution for streaming XML and JSON parsing.
- [spray-servlet](http://spray.io/documentation/spray-servlet/) is a small adapter layer that lets you use spray-routing in a servlet container.
  - Requires a servlet 3.0 container.
  - Streaming isn't availabe because of limitations of the servlet API.
  - This is for legacy situations. [spray-can](http://spray.io/documentation/spray-can/) is the preferred server.
  - The servlet API itself isn't exposed to the developer. It's used internally by Spray.
- Is Spray going to become the foundation for other technologies?
  - Anyone can do that, since it's Apache 2.0 licensed.
  - Would be open to such a discussion of bringing the Spray team on board to a larger project.
- Reservations
  - Is Spray re-inventing the wheel, considering all the effort that has gone into servlet containers and [Netty](https://netty.io/)?
    - Spray isn't attempting to replace servlets or Netty.
    - Spray aims to provide something easy and small to bridge Akka/Scala-based applications to the rest of the world.
