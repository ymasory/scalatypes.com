- Joined by [Tony Tam](https://twitter.com/fehguy), lead developer of [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com/), and [Wordnik](http://www.wordnik.com/) CEO.
- Swagger is a framework for _describing_ and _producing_ [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) APIs.
- The specification component describes the endpoints, the parameter types and counts, input validations, and the resulting data models.
- Once you have the specification:
  - [swagger-ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) can produce a beautiful documentation page for you.
  - [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen) can produce a client for you, in many languages
- Unlike [WSDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wsdl) and [WADL/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language), Swagger is simple, Json-based, and not meant to solve every problem. Some APIs cannot use Swagger.
- Relatively complex model objects can be described, even polymorphic types.
- Even though the specification is in Json, the APIs can choose to accept XML or other formats as input.
- Swagger also produces a service description that can be examined at run-time. This allows more granular access and documentation for different users of the API.
- Some web frameworks integrate Swagger support, allowing you to put the service description in the code, instead of in a separate Json file. Integrations exist for [JAX-RS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services), [Play 1](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.5/home), [Play 2](http://www.playframework.org/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), [Symfony](http://symfony.com/), [Restler](http://luracast.com/products/restler/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and [Scalatra](http://scalatra.org/) (which has the "cleanest" integration).
- swagger-codegen uses [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) templates to produce clients in Scala, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, Python 3, ActionScript, JavaScript, and Objective-C.
- Generation in the other direction is possible too. Given a Swagger specification, the code generator can write a Node.js, Ruby, or Scalatra API server.
- Chicken or egg? Write the Json API spec and generate a server, or write the server with Swagger support and generate the Json API spec?
- Swagger encourages best practices by focusing on the interface of your API.
- Swagger does not attempt to solve the REST versioning problem. It can facilitate, however, with version paths. Alternatively, a client can examine the run-time description representation and change its behavior according to changes in the API.
- Upcoming: supporting descriptions of authentication, including OAuth.
- Upcoming: supporting descriptions of protocol (e.g., http vs. https).
- Upcoming: supporting descriptions of format, without the need for path prefixes/suffixes (e.g., Json vs. XML).
- swagger-socket allows you to document a wire protocol with full-duplex communication with minimal latency and chatter. Native integration with Scalatra (via Atmosphere) is underway.
- [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) takes the extreme pain out of [WebSocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) development, transparently solving issues related firewalls, proxies, browser vendors/versions, protocol formats, and HTTP/1.1 fallback.
- Like actor-based systems, sockets are hard to document!
- Community contributions are welcome on [GitHub](http://swagger.wordnik.com/downloads), especially on the code generator (new languages, frameworks, and better implementations).
